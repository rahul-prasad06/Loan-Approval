Developed a predictive model to streamline loan approval processes by assessing applicant eligibility
based on financial and demographic factors.

Conducted data preprocessing: handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized
numerical features. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and correlations.

Engineered features such as debt to income, income-to-loan ratio and credit history impact to improve
prediction accuracy.

Built and fine-tuned machine learning models to achieve high prediction accuracy.

Achieved a model accuracy of 100% and provided actionable insights to improve loan approval efficiency.
